# data-from-Peri-L-Cell-2016

Data from the paper Peri√© L, Cell 2016 doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2015.11.059.

MPP, HSC and CMP have been labelled with a cellular barcode. Their progenies have been sorted and their barcode analyzed. 
The data available here have been quality filtered, renormalized to 10^5 reads and average over replicates as described in the paper. 

In the txt files, you''ll a matrix per mouse where:
- the column tag correspond to the identity of the barcodes
- the other columns correspond to the reads per barcode in a given sample. The name of the sample are coded as follow: "day_typeofprogenitor_micenumber_celltype". 
M or My for myeloid cells
E for erythroblasts
Dc for dendritic cells
B for B cells
